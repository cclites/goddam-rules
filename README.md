On a recent contract, I was in a position where I did not manage my own code. As part of my workflow, I would work on files that were on the development server of another. As this was a reskin for a distributed web application, it required that files be manually copied across servers in order to test and develop for a uniform appearance.

Also, access to hardware can be unpredictable, and if one works outside of typical office hours, there is usually little recourse other than waiting for someone to arrive on-site. As a means of compensating for unreliable hardware, and to regain control of my source code, I turned to Greasemonkey in order to inject my own code.
